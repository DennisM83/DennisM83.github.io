                <h3>Expansion Slots</h3>
                <p>
                    The Expansion Slots are used to expand the capabilities of the motherboard. When installing a card,
                    it's usually best
                    practice to check the documentation and install the drivers involved to run the device.
                    With some of the drivers, they could require you to install them either before or after you have
                    installed the physical card.
                    They usually there to add something like a video card, network, sound, or disk interface cards.
                    They're typically a half inch in width and can range between one to six inches in length.

                        There are two types of Expansion Slots, those consist of a PCI Expansion Slot and PCIe Expansion
                        Slot.
                        The PCI Expansion Slot is now considered a legacy component. The acronym PCI stands for
                        Peripheral Component Interconnect, but that usually not used, the shorthand is usually the
                        common pronunciation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The PCI slots can be recognized by their classic white color and they're usually about
                        three-inches in length.
                        In more modern computers, they could vary in color. These cards were either operating at bus
                        speeds of 33 MHz
                        or 66 MHz
                        over a 32-bit (4-byte) channel. So to find the data rates, you would calculate 33,000,000 Hz *
                        32 bit =
                        1,056,000,000 bits / s.
                        Then, you would divide this number by 8 (because of bytes / second). So, 1,056,000,000 / 8 =
                        132,000,000
                        MBps or 133 MBps. There's a little overhead to account for, but this calculation is a close
                        approximation.
                        Also, PCI ports are a shared bus. Meaning, if a bus is running at a speed of 66MHz, while a card
                        on the bus
                        is running at 33MHz, the combine bus would run at the 33MHz (lower speed), causing the 66MHz bus
                        to run at
                        half the potential. The cards were made in 3.3 v or 5v
                        versions. However, there are adapters that exist that are made as a universal adapters that
                        could handle
                        either / or. Those cards usually had notches in both positions according to the key positions on
                        the slot.
                        3.3v keys were common to see more toward the front of the motherboard in position and 5v is
                        located more
                        toward the rear. PCI in its hayday could connect just about any peripherals with the exception
                        of the
                        graphics card. As graphics cards accelerated in technology, so did games, and so did the
                        processing of
                        those graphics. This is why Intel decided to make its own port, the Accelerated Graphics Port or
                        AGP.
                        The PCI bus couldn't keep up with the information of both the CPU and graphics card. The two
                        technologies
                        were replaced by PCIe.

                    <p>
                        Most of your modern mobo's are going to feature the PCIe or (PCI Express). Its is possible to
                        find a
                        motherboard with
                        both PCI and PCIe slots for backward compatibility, but not APG. The PCIe kept the all the
                        flexibility
                        of PCI but is
                        faster than the AGP. PCIe also moved to a point-to-point switching connection. This type of
                        connection
                        allows the devices,
                        or nodes, to directly talk to one another on a connection. This also prevents other devices to
                        make a
                        connection and
                        keeps each device from slowing each other down. This is a contrast from the older bus
                        architecture you
                        find in older
                        PCI connections, which used a shared bandwidth among all the slots. PCIe uses more of a star
                        topology,
                        thus more of a
                        serial connection as apposed to a parallel connection. Since there is a point-to-point
                        communication
                        between these devices,
                        PCIe uses what is known as lanes. Lanes are the wires that basically send or receive the data to
                        and
                        from the device.
                        The combination of these wires is what is known as a link. Usually on a motherboard you'll find
                        a
                        x1, x4, or / and x16
                        (the "x" is pronounced "by"). These are the common PCIe slots that support their associated link
                        width.
                        There are actually
                        seven PCIe slots with various link widths. In addition to the common ones, there are x2, x8,
                        x12, x32.
                        You would rarely
                        run across these PCIe link widths, with the exception of the x8, which could be a little more
                        common
                        than the others.
                        Every PCIe slot is equipped with a 22-pin section that is used for grounding and voltage.
                        However,
                        aside from that,
                        you'll find that the PCIe slots are relative to physical size due to the fact they accommodate
                        for
                        the lanes needed
                        for the link. Transfer Rates are set on the PCIe slots, but take a loss to due to the 8b/10b
                        encoding.
                        Which means it
                        takes 10 bits to transfer 8. When you move up to PCIe 3.0, the encoding is switched to a
                        128b/130b,
                        which is a little
                        less overhead than the traditional encoding scheme.
                        This is also why version 3.0 is not exactly double the speed of version 2.0, but close enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PCIe extensions are popular among gamers, such as NVIDIA's SLI (Scalable Link Interface).
                        This card actually allows the user to combine multiple, identical graphics cards through an
                        adapter / bridge, allowing for communication exclusively with one another. The motherboard needs
                        support with for this type of set-up, but one card acts as a master and pools together the
                        combine graphics to feed to the monitor. Its important that these cards are stable,
                        otherwise there is a result in poor performance or failure.
