            <h3>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h3>
            <p>
                Random Access Memory (RAM) are modules used to store the most recent information and preparation for the
                CPU. This is also the primary memory. This is pretty much the workbench for the data when your CPU is
                working on it, storing it back onto the hard drive.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Since data is constantly being updated, the speed in which your computer runs is, in part, dictated
                    by the speed of the memory. The speed of the memory is also decided by the motherboard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DIMMs or Dual in-line memory modules are what you would find on a typical modern motherboard. These
                    are little circuit boards placed with signal pins / contacts on each side (hence the dual part) and
                    can transfer 64 bits at a time. This dual feature allows for quicker data transfer that their
                    predecessor, SIMMs. There are different numbers of pins a DIMM could have, such as 168-, 184-, 240-,
                    or 288-. These configurations are pretty common ones used today. Although, with DIMMs, they're
                    mainly used in a desktop setting. For a laptop, you would find SODIMMs (small outline DIMMs). These
                    are physically smaller which means they are going to have less pins. Both DIMMs and SODIMMs offer
                    different versions going from DDR SDRAM (double data rate SDRAM) up to DDR5 SDRAM (double data rate,
                    version 5, SDRAM).
                    Dynamic Random Access Memory or DRAM is the type you find on DIMMS. The Dynamic part of is in
                    reference to the fact these memory chips need to be constantly updated. Otherwise, the information
                    will be deleted. The reason that these chips are used in modern computers, is due to the fact they
                    are a little more simple and cheaper to manufacture. The Random Access part is due to the fact that
                    any data can be precisely. Unlike earlier versions, which information was stored on tape and had to
                    be re-wound to the exact location.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Synchronous DRAM is the type of DRAM on modern computers. The Synchronous part has to do with the
                    fact that its synched with the common clock cycle or Front-side bus speed. This prevents the CPU
                    from waiting on the memory to sync up. Older memory types relied on Asynchronous DRAM, which was
                    autonomous from the clock cycle. This type also required you to setup wait times through the BIOS to
                    access the information requested by the CPU. This resulted in slower performance.The way the SDRAM
                    uses the clock cycles to pull information is through a Double Date Rate or DDR. In older versions,
                    you would have only a SDR, which would just pull on single bit of data per clock cycle. With the
                    advancement of DDR, we're able to pull data on the upside and downside of the clock cycle, hence the
                    Double Data Rate. This also prevents added heat by maintaining the same clock cycle and increasing
                    the rate instead. With DDR, you also have different versions that have increased the amount of data
                    that could be transferred, as well as, becoming more power efficient. Each version is not forward or
                    backward compatible and the memory modules are also dependent on the FSB clock cycle of the
                    motherboard. There is a simple math equation, taking the FSB speed and multiplying that by 8 (bytes)
                    is a close, but not exact, frequency of the modules and those numbers are close to a marketing
                    standpoint when deciding which modules are needed for the motherboard. With each version, you're
                    essentially doubling the from the previous version. Although this these numbers are not exact, for
                    example, DDR2 doubles the rate of transfer, giving you two transfers on the upside and downside of
                    the cycle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since modern controller systems can operate by sending 64-bits over the data bus, there may be a
                    bottleneck situation that occurs when a CPU and Memory can operated fast than that. The motherboard
                    is then designed for single-, dual-, and triple-channel memory to alleviate this setback by using
                    multiple channels. However, when using a triple-channel connection, each channel is reduced but
                    still adding to a quicker performance than a dual channel. Some manufactures will added color coding
                    to the channels to indicate which channel is required to be filled by a pair or trio of modules.
                    These modules must the exact same pair, otherwise you run the risk of performance issues and / or
                    failures. Consulting the manufacturer's mobo documentation, you can then figure out the maximum
                    amount of memory you would need. Also, some memory comes with error checking and correction. In
                    order for the memory to check for an error it uses what is called parity. Parity is by adding an
                    additional bit of data (usually nothing that adds to the actual data) and checks against the data if
                    see if its even or odd. Depending on which type of error checking is permitted (even or odd numbers
                    of data), the outcoming is expected, otherwise an error is thrown. Also, say if the parity checking
                    is expecting an even number and there are multiple errors, as long as it returns an expected
                    outcome, no error is detected. This is a very base line way of checking as it adds no information on
                    what the error is or how to corrected the error. This is where ECC comes in. ECC can detect two
                    errors that exist within a byte and is able to actually offer corrections for one. This is done by
                    adding a attaching a bit to the stored data. When the data is access, an algorithm is then performed
                    and if a 0 is returned, otherwise it throws an error.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from DRAM, there is Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) which is generally used for cache
                    memory. This type of memory also doesnâ€™t have to be refreshed like DRAM, and offers quicker access
                    times such as 10 nanoseconds as opposed to the 40 ns offered by DRAM. This type of memory is more
                    expensive, which is why it isn't used on a larger scale.
                    ROM or Read-Only Memory is also a form of memory, usually attached to the motherboard for the BIOS
                    and POST. In the early years, this type of memory, once written, couldn't be altered. It's had some
                    upgrades throughout the years, offering many ways of being re-written. Most modern mobos use flash
                    memory, which is a type of PROM (Programmable ROM).

                <h3>Expansion Slots</h3>
                <p>
                    The Expansion Slots are used to expand the capabilities of the motherboard. When installing a card,
                    it's usually best
                    practice to check the documentation and install the drivers involved to run the device.
                    With some of the drivers, they could require you to install them either before or after you have
                    installed the physical card.
                    They usually there to add something like a video card, network, sound, or disk interface cards.
                    They're typically a half inch in width and can range between one to six inches in length.

                        There are two types of Expansion Slots, those consist of a PCI Expansion Slot and PCIe Expansion
                        Slot.
                        The PCI Expansion Slot is now considered a legacy component. The acronym PCI stands for
                        Peripheral Component Interconnect, but that usually not used, the shorthand is usually the
                        common pronunciation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The PCI slots can be recognized by their classic white color and they're usually about
                        three-inches in length.
                        In more modern computers, they could vary in color. These cards were either operating at bus
                        speeds of 33 MHz
                        or 66 MHz
                        over a 32-bit (4-byte) channel. So to find the data rates, you would calculate 33,000,000 Hz *
                        32 bit =
                        1,056,000,000 bits / s.
                        Then, you would divide this number by 8 (because of bytes / second). So, 1,056,000,000 / 8 =
                        132,000,000
                        MBps or 133 MBps. There's a little overhead to account for, but this calculation is a close
                        approximation.
                        Also, PCI ports are a shared bus. Meaning, if a bus is running at a speed of 66MHz, while a card
                        on the bus
                        is running at 33MHz, the combine bus would run at the 33MHz (lower speed), causing the 66MHz bus
                        to run at
                        half the potential. The cards were made in 3.3 v or 5v
                        versions. However, there are adapters that exist that are made as a universal adapters that
                        could handle
                        either / or. Those cards usually had notches in both positions according to the key positions on
                        the slot.
                        3.3v keys were common to see more toward the front of the motherboard in position and 5v is
                        located more
                        toward the rear. PCI in its hayday could connect just about any peripherals with the exception
                        of the
                        graphics card. As graphics cards accelerated in technology, so did games, and so did the
                        processing of
                        those graphics. This is why Intel decided to make its own port, the Accelerated Graphics Port or
                        AGP.
                        The PCI bus couldn't keep up with the information of both the CPU and graphics card. The two
                        technologies
                        were replaced by PCIe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of your modern mobo's are going to feature the PCIe or (PCI Express). Its is possible to
                        find a
                        motherboard with
                        both PCI and PCIe slots for backward compatibility, but not APG. The PCIe kept the all the
                        flexibility
                        of PCI but is
                        faster than the AGP. PCIe also moved to a point-to-point switching connection. This type of
                        connection
                        allows the devices,
                        or nodes, to directly talk to one another on a connection. This also prevents other devices to
                        make a
                        connection and
                        keeps each device from slowing each other down. This is a contrast from the older bus
                        architecture you
                        find in older
                        PCI connections, which used a shared bandwidth among all the slots. PCIe uses more of a star
                        topology,
                        thus more of a
                        serial connection as apposed to a parallel connection. Since there is a point-to-point
                        communication
                        between these devices,
                        PCIe uses what is known as lanes. Lanes are the wires that basically send or receive the data to
                        and
                        from the device.
                        The combination of these wires is what is known as a link. Usually on a motherboard you'll find
                        a
                        x1, x4, or / and x16
                        (the "x" is pronounced "by"). These are the common PCIe slots that support their associated link
                        width.
                        There are actually
                        seven PCIe slots with various link widths. In addition to the common ones, there are x2, x8,
                        x12, x32.
                        You would rarely
                        run across these PCIe link widths, with the exception of the x8, which could be a little more
                        common
                        than the others.
                        Every PCIe slot is equipped with a 22-pin section that is used for grounding and voltage.
                        However,
                        aside from that,
                        you'll find that the PCIe slots are relative to physical size due to the fact they accommodate
                        for
                        the lanes needed
                        for the link. Transfer Rates are set on the PCIe slots, but take a loss to due to the 8b/10b
                        encoding.
                        Which means it
                        takes 10 bits to transfer 8. When you move up to PCIe 3.0, the encoding is switched to a
                        128b/130b,
                        which is a little
                        less overhead than the traditional encoding scheme.
                        This is also why version 3.0 is not exactly double the speed of version 2.0, but close enough.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        PCIe extensions are popular among gamers, such as NVIDIA's SLI (Scalable Link Interface).
                        This card actually allows the user to combine multiple, identical graphics cards through an
                        adapter / bridge, allowing for communication exclusively with one another. The motherboard needs
                        support with for this type of set-up, but one card acts as a master and pools together the
                        combine graphics to feed to the monitor. Its important that these cards are stable,
                        otherwise there is a result in poor performance or failure.
